0.14.4 Okt-30-2012
------------------
- fixed another bug when decoding Float64 
- getDataDefinition of all kinds of DataObjects and DataAttributes now possible
- modified toString() function of most DataAttributes to print more valuable information

0.14.3 Sep-18-2012
------------------
- fixed decoding of Float32 and Float64 
- fixed getChildren(fc) Function in LogicalNode

0.14.2 Aug-23-2012
------------------
- major refactoring to make code more efficient and easier to
  maintain. Many classes have been renamed and/or relocated.
- the ability to use different SCSM was completely removed because
  only one mapping existed so far: the MMS mapping. No other Mapping
  seems to have a chance against MMS simply because MMS is already in
  use and works.

  changed a little, see the sampeServer for details

0.12.0 Jul-31-2012
------------------

- client no longer hangs when receiving ApplError Reports

0.11.0 Jul-02-2012
------------------
- new jASN1 version that can decode empty Object Identifiers
- added mms authentication capability
- fixed multi thread issues in TSAPConnection of MMS mapping
- added FLOAT64 from IEC61400-2
- added SampleReportClient to demonstrate how to use reporting with the client
- some improvements to client receiver thread
- some other small bug fixes

0.10.0 Mai-14-2012
------------------
- restructuring: code moved to src folder
- new jASN1 version which fixes bug in decoding empty bitstrings
- receving "Check" data does not cause errors anymore
- ASN.1 buffers are automatically resized in the client

0.9.9 Mar-29-2012
-----------------
- added DataSet Services for client and server
- added getReport methods and processReport for the client -> they
  will get a report from the queue and return a report object with the
  updated data
- fixed getDataValues for array structures 
- disabled sending SpecificationWithResult in read request because
  some clients cannot cope with it
- fixed bug in RFC 1006 part
- added receiver thread in client so that reports can be received at any time
- added VisibleString65 to be compatible with some version1.0 servers
- avoid srcRef == 0 because some servers cannot cope with it 

0.9.8 Feb-22-2012
-----------------

0.9.6 Feb-20-2012
-----------------
- when importing Eclipse projects: GRADLE_HOME was replaced by GRADLE_USER_HOME
- removed duplicate entries from tar distribution file
- Remote TSAPs can now be addressed using a T-Selector. The client can
  set the T-Selector like this:
  MmsScsmClientSAP clientSAP = new MmsScsmClientSAP();
  clientSAP.acseSAP.tSAP.tSelRemote = new byte[] { 0, 1 };
