openiec61850
============

Fork of the openiec61850 library from http://www.openmuc.org/, by Fraunhofer. This fork is very much work in progress.

So far, authentication support has been added to the Server. Our next step is to add TLS support to both server and client.

The intention is to get this merged in the main distribution.
